# BusIn-Checker
I noticed that attendance for our college bus for entry was being taken manually every day — a time-consuming and error-prone process. So, I decided to do something about it.

I built an RFID-based attendance system using an Arduino Uno and RFID tags, allowing Drivers to simply tap their cards when they Enter the gate. This automates the entire attendance process, making it faster, more accurate, and hassle-free.

It’s a small project, but one that solves a real-world problem
